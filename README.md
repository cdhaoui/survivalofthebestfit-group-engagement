# Survival of the Best Fit - Group Engagement

You can play the game here https://cdhaoui.github.io/survivalofthebestfit-group-engagement/

This is an interactive simulation to explain AI bias in a fun group activity in-class or online using a live group voting mechanism.
It is an extended version of the original game https://github.com/survivalofthebestfit/survivalofthebestfit, introducing group dynamics where students scan a QR code to join and start voting using their mobile devices.
This helps boost students' engagement by turning the simulation into a collaborative learning experience rather than an individual activity.

## Concept
Survival of the Best Fit is an educational web simulation to shed light on how AI and ML algorithms can be biased, particularly by looking at how using ML in hiring practices can reinforce workforce inequality. It aims to break down the barrier between internet users and the technologies behind building the internet (particularly AI and ML), by giving them an understanding of how decisions made by developers of recruitment applications directly impact the decisions produced by algorithms.

## Group Engagement
At the start of the game, students scan a QR code to join the teacher's session. Then, as candidates are displayed, students can take the role of recruiters and click "Accept" or "Reject" the candidates on their mobile devices to reflect their decisions. The results are displayed on the teacher's screen and projected to the class (or via video conference). Final decisions are based on the majority vote (to accept or reject a candidate), thereby highlighting group bias.
